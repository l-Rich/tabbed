### Welcome to the TABBED APP

We have all planned a group trip, or been apart of a group trip right? And group trips are great until a group expense can only use one payment source. So now you have to all pull out your calulators and decide who had the shrimp appetizer and how many mimosas did Julie have? Insert the Tabbed app! A way to put all of your expenses into a tabulator and decide your portion of the bill!

### Your project idea 
My capstone will be a web application that will allow friends to split travel expenses. A group leader will be able to start a group trip and capture all expected expenses. A member of the group will be able to accept or decline participation in that activity then  their portion of the price will be added to their total cost.

### Your tech stack (frontend, backend, database)
Django, PostgreSQL, Bootstrap

### List of backend models and their properties
User
Activities
Lodging
Expenses

### React component hierarchy (if applicable)

### User stories
A user will be able start a group trip. The user who starts the trip will be the group leader.  The group leader will be able to invite members to the trip. A member can accept or decline invitation. A member who accepts invitation will be placed in the travel group. The group leader will select trip destination. The members and the group leader can add expenses. The members and the group leader can accept or decline invitation to expenses. If a member or group leader accepts an expense the expense will be split evenly among everyone who accepted. The portion of the expense accepted by a member or group leader will be added to a running tab. A member and group leader will be able to see their total owed for the entire trips expenses. A group leader will be able to mark if a member had paid or not.
